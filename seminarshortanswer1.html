	<h4 class = “center”>AP Courses</h4>
	<br>
	<h5 class = “header-margin”>When do students usually start to take AP classes?</h5>
	<br>
	<p class = “mb-1”>Ellen Wang: You can start taking AP courses at LHS in your sophomore year (10th grade). I think it is also possible to self-study and take the AP exam at a different school.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>What were your thoughts on AP Physics C?</h5>
	<br>
	<p>Alicia Li: I thought it was an interesting class. It definitely gave me some intuition for how the physical world works. It’s a lot of math and one of the trickier AP courses. Would recommend it if you're interested in any field of STEM.
		<br>Jamie Yu: Probably one of my favorite classes at LHS - but I also really enjoy physics & had a great teacher. I would definitely take it especially if you enjoy math/physics or are interested in engineering.</p>
	<br>
	<h5> Do you need previous physics knowledge in order to take physics at AP level? Any advice on how to be prepared in order to take AP physics?</h5>
	<p> Alicia Li: Nope! AP Physics C was my first physics class. Having a strong math background and taking calculus beforehand definitely helps.
		<br>Audi Lin: From my experience at LHS most people come in knowing nothing about physics. It depends on the school but you should learn everything through the class and ask the teacher for help if necessary.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>For anyone who took it, was Advanced Computer Programming worth it?</h5>
	<br>
	<p>Alicia Li: The class was entirely labs so it was good coding practice but there were no lectures/teaching. The theory in the class was not in depth at all so I don’t think it gives a strong background for CS. But if you’re just looking for more coding (and for some reason enjoy programming in C) maybe give it a try.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>What was your AP course load like?</h5>
	<p>Jamie Yu: I took 2 a year. It was pretty chill.
		<br>Audi Lin: I took 2 AP's in sophomore year, 6 in junior year and 3 in seniors year (which was a LOT). There were some AP courses I ended up regretting taking because I wasn't actually interested in them and only took them because I thought I was expected to... In general I would recommend challenging yourself to take classes you think you'll enjoy... you don't want to regret your decision to take a course you're not ready for or don't like :) </p>
	<br>
	<h5>Is it true that you have to take more than 10 AP's to get into prestigious universities?</h5>
	<br>
	<p>Isabel Li: Nope! The number of APs depends on your school (how you compare to other students) and the specific AP (some are harder than others). 
		<br>Alicia Li: I took 8 APs at LHS which I think is a solid amount (4 sophomore year 2 junior year 2 senior year).</p>
	<br>
	<h5>What was the maximum amount of AP's you took in a year and how did you manage the amount of work?</h5>
	<br>
	<p>Isabel Li: The max amount I took in a year was 4. I think the workload and stress depends more on the teacher than anything and all of my teachers were incredibly easy going. One strategy I used was setting a time limit (no all-nighters!) on my studying and another was maximizing the small chunks of time during the day (ex. time between extracurriculars). </p>
	<br>
	<h5>What were some really helpful AP classes?</h5>
	<br>
	<p>Alicia Li: It depends a lot on your interests. For me AP Calculus was probably most helpful since calculus is so important (for STEM fields). I also loved AP World and AP US History since they expanded my knowledge about why the world is how it is today. All of the AP science classes were helpful too since they introduced me to those fields.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>Any recommendations on how to spread out AP classes during the high school years?</h5>
	<br>
	<p>Pria Sawhney: I did 2 my sophomore year 2 my junior year and 4 my senior year (3 classes but 4 tests). I think this balance worked pretty well for me - I had a bunch of honors classes sprinkled throughout as well. Senior year was definitely the hardest (APC was the toughest class I’ve taken so far). That being said, this is so individual - I focused entirely on high level STEM courses which is not to everyone's taste!</p>
	<br>
	<h5>Did any of you guys take AP computer science principles and if so what was the class/amount of work like?</h5>
	<br>
	<p>Pria Sawhney: I took it in 10th grade - I found that it was a fairly simple class even for people without a CS background. Kind of like Scratch when it comes to coding.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>Did you self study any AP’s?</h5>
	<br>
	<p>Audi Lin: I personally self-studied AP Economics(only seniors at LHS can take it) and AP Computer Science A (I couldn't fit it into my schedule but already knew how to code)  but I know other people tend to self-study for AP Literature since LHS doesn't offer it.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>Is heimler a good resource to put time in for AP world and APUSH?</h5>
	<br>
	<p>Eli Olcott: Yes! Definitely good for encoding information but also the AP videos are great.
		<br>Alicia Li: Yes! helped me a lot for studying for the AP Exam.
		<br>Jason Alexander: Yes! For APUSH also test yourself online for example with http://www.historyteacher.net/USQuizMainPage.html</p>
	<br>
	<h5>Which textbooks or online resources did you find were most helpful for AP biology or AP world?</h5>
	<br>
	<p>Audi Lin: If you're taking these courses the teacher will give you all the resources you might need since they have the most experience with teaching these classes and you shouldn't need to buy your own textbooks. For cramming/review, Fiveable has good cram sheets that will list everything you need to know. Khan Academy also has some resources and 5 Steps to a 5 also has some good workbooks.
	<br>
	<h5>Is taking AP's in senior year too late if you want to get into a prestigious university?</h5>
	<p>Isabel Li: Definitely not! You can write your senior APs into the common application.</p>
	<br>
	<h4>Extracurriculars</h4>
	<br>
	<h5>Based on your experience how many extracurriculars you may likely keep up during the high school years?</h5>
	<p>Eli Olcott: This is just my experience but I have tried 8 different things at once. It was stressful. I wasn't able to have a lot of friends at the time and did them all okay. In my opinion and something I am thinking about I would choose 3 major things you want to commit most of your time to. Then go all in on the opportunities they present. Also make sure you’re not forcing yourself to like something you don’t. (Why casting a wide net to try new things is important.) You will always be able to work harder on things you truly enjoy. 
		<br>Audi Lin: In my experience it depends on how much time you have to do extracurriculars and what you're willing to do. In freshman year I had a lot of time since I had a relatively light course load and therefore tried many different things. However by junior year I was taking many AP classes and spending so much time doing homework that I only had time for two extracurriculars. It's definitely possible to do more but the more you do the less sleep you get… </p>
	<br>
	<h5>I heard that in LHS if you would like to join a team to participate in an academic contest you had to go through a test selection. Is it true? If I were in LHS would I have chances to participate in these teams? (I’m a rising freshman who has self-studied Calculus BC and has qualified for AIME in 8th grade.)</h5>
	<p>Jamie Yu: For most academic competitions this is the case - it is the case for Math Team, Envirothon, Science Bowl, Science Olympiad, National Ocean Sciences Bowl (and likely others that I am neglecting to mention). However, there are tons of stuff that you can do that is not school affiliated that is not a school-based tryout (i.e. Olympiads).</p>
	<br>
	<h5> Does the LHS robotic team only compete for FTC?</h5>
	<p>Pria Sawhney: LHS has many VEX teams and two FTC teams. The VEX teams were previously home teams that were just incorporated into the school while the FTC teams have been around for 13-14 years. VEX teams have a tryout system while the FTC teams can be joined through being scouted from the LHS Robotics Club which anyone can join.</p>
	<br>
	<h5> Can Pria share more about FTC?</h5>
	<p>Pria Sawhney: Sure! FTC and FIRST were a huge part of my life in highschool. It helped me learn that I really was interested in engineering and that I was passionate about building and hands-on learning. It's really accessible to join at LHS as students join the club and then get recruited to join the teams. It's a great way to get into actual engineering that the highschool curriculum does not otherwise provide.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>How to prepare to try out for the VEX team?</h5>
	<p>Audi Lin: As far as I know none of us did VEX (Pria and I both did FTC). In general, it’s good to demonstrate that you're willing to learn-- no one expects you to come in knowing everything since you'll learn more while on the team.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>How do you study for the olympiads/science teams?</h5>
	<p>Jamie Yu: Google is your best friend! look at websites - there are often guides. Ask older people who have done it before - they generally have the best tips & tricks and we are generally always willing to offer help.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>What are your opinions on sports both amateur and high level?</h5>
	<p>Ellen Wang: High school team sports offer a wonderful opportunity to nurture  a sense of community. Participation in a team setting imparts valuable collaboration skills, even when working with individuals from diverse backgrounds, as everyone strives towards a shared objective. Sports also provide an enjoyable means of physical exercise and the opportunity to forge new connections. The only drawback is that sports can be time-consuming due to practices and competitions.  However, this presents an opportunity to develop effective  time management skills and learn to prioritize tasks. If you are passionate about sports and plan to continue throughout high school, it is undoubtedly a rewarding pursuit.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>Is it hard to manage things you like with things you have to do? I'm passionate about a lot of things but a lot of people say that it is pretty difficult to keep up with them. I feel like most people actually discourage it.</h5>
	<p>Isabel Li: I had a lot of things I enjoyed and at times it was hard to balance all of it. However, having a wide range of interests also allowed me to take a break from each one (ex. if dance was frustrating I could focus my mind on science for a while). It's definitely up to you and your personal limits though personally 2-3 big interests worked the best.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>I started sophomore year in LHS (I am in China for freshmen year). I did something but I always feel like it is too late for me to begin my activities. How do you deal with this anxious feeling?</h5>
	<p>Isabel Li: You aren't the only one! I didn't do much my freshman year and to be honest I don't regret it at all! It's never too late -- some things, especially self-started projects take only a couple of weeks to start up. I'm a super anxious person as well and the best way for me to deal with this feeling was to find an outlet (ex. movies hanging with friends) and focus on self-care. There is no to-do list so any position you are in right now is perfectly ok.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>How do you guys start your own organizations? What prompted you?</h5>
	<p>Alicia Li: My organization started as a YouTube channel run by just me and grew to an organization because I realized I could reach more people with a team. My advice is to truly be passionate about what you’re doing because it is a lot of time and energy. There are already a lot of super cool organizations you can be a part of so I recommend only starting something if you genuinely see a gap that you can fill. Don’t feel pressured to start something for the sake of starting something.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>If I have a really time consuming club, what do you put first: schoolwork or practicing/studying for the club?</h5>
	<p>Jamie Yu: I put the club first generally but my academics were always fine - make sure your academics don't suffer too bad.
		<br>Audi Lin: That's a decision you'll have to make for yourself-you know yourself best. High school is a learning process and even if you end up making a choice you regret you'll learn from it :)</p>
	<br>
	<h5>Was it really hard to get into any teams like math competition, science bowl etc teams?</h5>
	<p>Pria Sawhney: In my experience (NOSB FTC) not really! Many science teams are built to teach newcomers and help them build up their knowledge. Also if you are interested and passionate about certain subjects it's really easy to go down those rabbit holes and get on certain teams because you love learning the content.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>How exactly are captains of a club decided and what should any individual member do to aim towards that goal?</h5>
	<p>Pria Sawhney: Generally captains are decided by a combination of previous captains/the mentors or advisors of the club. To aim towards that goal I would recommend being diligent showing up for meetings showing that you prioritize the club/team and focusing your efforts at improving/studying for whatever that activity concerns.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>Do the extracurriculars you all mentioned (teams and such) require starting from a young age?</h5>
	<p>Alicia Li: Nope! Middle school and high school are great times for exploring different fields. I didn’t start computer science seriously until 10th grade.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>What are the competitions that people in Track or Cross Country have to go to and how often do they appear?</h5>
	<p>Audi Lin: None of us did track/cross country but for high school sports there's typically practice every day after school and 1-2 meets every week. The special meets like regionals/states might be on the weekend and happen toward the end of the season. For LHS there's cross country in the fall, indoor track in the winter, and outdoor track in the spring.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>What are some clubs that you guys suggest? Also to add on that if you join a major club later than most what should you do to “catch up”.</h5>
	<p>Isabel Li: All the clubs I joined at LHS were pretty great but I do admit that some clubs at LHS aren't very active. To "catch up” I think all you need to do is show that you are committed and passionate about the cause. Stay proactive and volunteer when they need help and they'll definitely notice you.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>How big are some of the clubs? (for example how many people attend math club)</h5>
	<p> Alicia Li: Math team is on the larger side of clubs. About 40-50 people attend the competitions. Around 25 people consistently show up for meetings. Other clubs like LexMACs have around 15 people. Some small clubs are around 5 people.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>What are some STEM competitions you guys recommend participating in?</h5>
	<p>Alicia Li: STEM olympiads like AMC 10/12 -> AIME USACO USABO USAPHO USESO are all great.</p>
