<h1 class = “center”>AP Courses</h1>
<br>
<h2 class = “header-margin”>When do students usually start to take AP classes?</h2>
<br>
<p class = “mb-1”>Ellen Wang: You can start taking AP courses at LHS in your sophomore year (10th grade). I think it is also possible to self-study and take the AP exam at a different school.</p>
<br>
<h2>What were your thoughts on AP Physics C?</h2>
<br>
<p>Alicia Li: I thought it was an interesting class. It definitely gave me some intuition for how the physical world works. It’s a lot of math and one of the trickier AP courses. Would recommend it if you're interested in any field of STEM.
	<br>Jamie Yu: Probably one of my favorite classes at LHS - but I also really enjoy physics & had a great teacher. I would definitely take it especially if you enjoy math/physics or are interested in engineering.</p>
<br>
<h2> Do you need previous physics knowledge in order to take physics at AP level? Any advice on how to be prepared in order to take AP physics?</h2>
<p> Alicia Li: Nope! AP Physics C was my first physics class. Having a strong math background and taking calculus beforehand definitely helps.
	<br>Audi Lin: From my experience at LHS most people come in knowing nothing about physics. It depends on the school but you should learn everything through the class and ask the teacher for help if necessary.</p>
<br>
<h2>For anyone who took it, was Advanced Computer Programming worth it?</h2>
<br>
<p>Alicia Li: The class was entirely labs so it was good coding practice but there were no lectures/teaching. The theory in the class was not in depth at all so I don’t think it gives a strong background for CS. But if you’re just looking for more coding (and for some reason enjoy programming in C) maybe give it a try.</p>
<br>
<h2>What was your AP course load like?</h2>
<p>Jamie Yu: I took 2 a year. It was pretty chill.
	<br>Audi Lin: I took 2 AP's in sophomore year, 6 in junior year and 3 in seniors year (which was a LOT). There were some AP courses I ended up regretting taking because I wasn't actually interested in them and only took them because I thought I was expected to... In general I would recommend challenging yourself to take classes you think you'll enjoy... you don't want to regret your decision to take a course you're not ready for or don't like :) </p>
<br>
<h2>Is it true that you have to take more than 10 AP's to get into prestigious universities?</h2>
<br>
<p>Isabel Li: Nope! The number of APs depends on your school (how you compare to other students) and the specific AP (some are harder than others). 
	<br>Alicia Li: I took 8 APs at LHS which I think is a solid amount (4 sophomore year 2 junior year 2 senior year).</p>
<br>
<h2>What was the maximum amount of AP's you took in a year and how did you manage the amount of work?</h2>
<br>
<p>Isabel Li: The max amount I took in a year was 4. I think the workload and stress depends more on the teacher than anything and all of my teachers were incredibly easy going. One strategy I used was setting a time limit (no all-nighters!) on my studying and another was maximizing the small chunks of time during the day (ex. time between extracurriculars). </p>
<br>
<h2>What were some really helpful AP classes?</h2>
<br>
<p>Alicia Li: It depends a lot on your interests. For me AP Calculus was probably most helpful since calculus is so important (for STEM fields). I also loved AP World and AP US History since they expanded my knowledge about why the world is how it is today. All of the AP science classes were helpful too since they introduced me to those fields.</p>
<br>
<h2>Any recommendations on how to spread out AP classes during the high school years?</h2>
<br>
<p>Pria Sawhney: I did 2 my sophomore year 2 my junior year and 4 my senior year (3 classes but 4 tests). I think this balance worked pretty well for me - I had a bunch of honors classes sprinkled throughout as well. Senior year was definitely the hardest (APC was the toughest class I’ve taken so far). That being said, this is so individual - I focused entirely on high level STEM courses which is not to everyone's taste!</p>
<br>
<h2>Did any of you guys take AP computer science principles and if so what was the class/amount of work like?</h2>
<br>
<p>Pria Sawhney: I took it in 10th grade - I found that it was a fairly simple class even for people without a CS background. Kind of like Scratch when it comes to coding.</p>
<br>
<h2>Did you self study any AP’s?</h2>
<br>
<p>Audi Lin: I personally self-studied AP Economics(only seniors at LHS can take it) and AP Computer Science A (I couldn't fit it into my schedule but already knew how to code)  but I know other people tend to self-study for AP Literature since LHS doesn't offer it.</p>
<br>
<h2>Is heimler a good resource to put time in for AP world and APUSH?</h2>
<br>
<p>Eli Olcott: Yes! Definitely good for encoding information but also the AP videos are great.
	<br>Alicia Li: Yes! helped me a lot for studying for the AP Exam.
	<br>Jason Alexander: Yes! For APUSH also test yourself online for example with http://www.historyteacher.net/USQuizMainPage.html</p>
<br>
<h2>Which textbooks or online resources did you find were most helpful for AP biology or AP world?</h2>
<br>
<p>Audi Lin: If you're taking these courses the teacher will give you all the resources you might need since they have the most experience with teaching these classes and you shouldn't need to buy your own textbooks. For cramming/review, Fiveable has good cram sheets that will list everything you need to know. Khan Academy also has some resources and 5 Steps to a 5 also has some good workbooks.
<br>
<h2>Is taking AP's in senior year too late if you want to get into a prestigious university?</h2>
<p>Isabel Li: Definitely not! You can write your senior APs into the common application.</p>
